# redsys-opencart
Redsys virtual POS module for OpenCart 3.0.2.0

Based on the existing module for OpenCart available on 
[Redsys website] (http://www.redsys.es/comercio-electronico/modulos/redsys_opencart.zip) 
we have made this one for OpenCart 3 (tested up to version 3.0. 2.0), 
which has substantial changes compared to the previous ones:

* Change templates to Twig template engine
* New location of Payments (within Extensions both in the admin and in the store)
* Complete translation into Spanish from Spain (es-es) and English from Great Britain
(en-gb) with UTF-8 encoding (without BOM)
